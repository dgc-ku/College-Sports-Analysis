# Impact of College Sports on Universities

## Introduction
University sports programs are key to building a schoolâ€™s reputation, attracting students, and driving financial growth. These programs generate substantial revenue, draw in students, and influence important university metrics like undergraduate enrollment and graduation rates. However, the relationship is still unclear between sports revenue and these critical university metrics. With the increasing media coverage on all college sports, this project aims to investigate the connection between the revenue generated by the top five major sports (football, basketball, baseball/softball, ice hockey, and soccer) and its impact on undergraduate enrollment and graduation rates at universities in Massachusetts. 

## Datasets
By analyzing historical data on revenue, enrollment, and graduation rates from **2009 to 2021**, we can identify trends and relationships that may guide universities in optimizing their resource allocation and policy decisions. Here the following datasets used for the analysis:
- Revenue Data: Annual earnings from the top five major sports programs
- Undergraduate Enrollment Data: Yearly enrollment figures for undergraduate students
- Graduation Rate Data: Annual graduation rates for each institution

## Data Cleaning
As with any data science project, no dataset is perfectly clean and must be properly prepared for thorough analysis:
- Merging Datasets: The revenue, enrollment, and graduation rate datasets were
consolidated into a single dataset to ensure consistency across variables.
- Handling NA Values: Missing values were addressed based on their context. NA values in the graduation rate and enrollment data were removed to prevent
inaccuracies, while NA values in revenue data, due to sports cancellations during COVID-19) were replaced with zeros.
- Normalization: Variables with different scales (e.g., revenue in millions, enrollment as raw counts, and graduation rates as percentages) were normalized to enable meaningful comparisons

## Findings
### Correlation
After data cleaning, I calculated a 'score' for each university based on their undergraduate enrollment and graduation rate. This score was calculated based on normalization on all schools. After aggregating revenue of each school and comparing it to the total 'score' of each university, I found that there is a weak correlation between revenue and graduation rate (r = 0.37), but a **moderate correlation** between revenue and undergraduate enrollment (r = 0.59). Below is a correlation matrix between revenue and the two university demographics measured:
